# openaps-menu

This is the repository holding the menu-based software code, which you may choose to add to an Explorer HAT or other screen-based rig in order to visualize and enter information into a Pi-based #OpenAPS rig.

See [here](https://github.com/EnhancedRadioDevices/Explorer-HAT) for more details on the Explorer HAT hardware.
